    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given data from an Audiobook app. Logically, it relates only to the audio versions of books. Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once, that's why he/she is in the database. We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that if a customer has a low probability of coming back, there is no reason to spend any money on advertizing to him/her. If we can focus our efforts ONLY on customers that are likely to convert again, we can make great savings. Moreover, this model can identify the most important metrics for a customer to come back again. Identifying new customers creates value and growth opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a .csv summarizing the data. There are several variables: Customer ID, Book length in mins_avg (average of all purchases), Book length in minutes_sum (sum of all purchases), Price Paid_avg (average of all purchases), Price paid_sum (sum of all purchases), Review (a Boolean variable), Review (out of 10), Total minutes listened, Completion (from 0 to 1), Support requests (number), and Last visited minus purchase date (in days).\n",
    "\n",
    "So these are the inputs (excluding customer ID, as it is completely arbitrary. It's more like a name, than a number).\n",
    "\n",
    "The targets are a Boolean variable (so 0, or 1). We are taking a period of 2 years in our inputs, and the next 6 months as targets. So, in fact, we are predicting if: based on the last 2 years of activity and engagement, a customer will convert in the next 6 months. 6 months sounds like a reasonable time. If they don't convert after 6 months, chances are they've gone to a competitor or didn't like the Audiobook way of digesting information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is simple: create a machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classification problem with two classes: won't buy and will buy, represented by 0s and 1s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"
